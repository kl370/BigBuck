Team Project Assignment Summary – BigBucks


(10 points) Enable customers to interact with your website.
•	Instead of a running instance of the Big Bucks (formerly Altoro Mutual) website, we created a new system for our website. Although it is much harder than just coding based on codes of Altoro. We feel it would be better if we want to have better customer using experience.
•	We enabled new users to create new Big Bucks accounts for themselves. We tested using many different username and password combinations. I also asked my roommate to try that, and there are many users in our SQL workbench (2 points).
•	We also created a login interface for existing user.
•	We also have error messages for invalid usernames or passwords. In the second last class we learnt about ethics and safety and found out how vital a secure system is.


(10 points) Enable account holders to 'buy' and 'sell' shares of stock, track them in their accounts
•	We enabled buying and selling function. The UI is reached by clicking on “Submit Orders Here”.
•	There are two types of orders. 'Buy': Exchange customer account USD for integer number of shares at market price at the time of the exchange (during market hours.) Do not execute actual trade, only record effects of the trade in the customer's account. 'Sell': Exchange specified integer number of shares owned by customer for USD, applying market rules (open markets, market price.)
•	We get live data from Yahoo Finance which gets us extra two points.
•	Each account holder can be credited $1,000,000 in their cash account, for use in buying and selling stocks (not real money, not real stocks, just balances representing the portfolio each account holder chooses.)


(10 points) Enable customers to consider history as they evaluate their holdings
•	This UI can be reached by clicking on “Historical Information”.
•	We stored at least five years of daily historical data (or all data for stocks less than five years old) for each stock held by account holders.
•	The user can type in the ticker of the stock they want to know about and click on search, then the line graph of the monthly price of the stock is shown on the chart.
•	We stored at least five years of SPY index data (daily data.)


(15 points) Enable customers to analyze the risk-return profile of their portfolio
•	We understood how to calculate Sharpe ratio and understood how to calculate it for the portfolio. However, we tried hard to inteegrate our sharpe ratio codes but haven't succeed.


(10 points) Enable customers to run reports on their holdings
•	This function can also be found on the homepage after logging in.
•	We listed stocks owned by ticker symbol, shares held, and price per share.


(15 points) UI/UX Design Focus - Functionality: Provide customers with advanced charting features
•	This UI can be reached by clicking on “Advanced charting”.
•	We included the price plot and the three types of returns plots
•	We included the stock price versus index price chart shown in Figure 7.1 of Balch, the stock return versus index return time series chart shown in Figure 7.2 of Balch, and the scatter plot of stock return versus index return shown in Figure 7.3 of Balch.
•	The user can choose the type of graph they want by typing in the stock ticker and then choose the graph type.


(5 points) UI/UX Design Focus - Prototyping I: Paper prototype (UI/UX Design Focus, Prototyping I)
•	We created a paper prototype of the portion of our user interface that allows a user to chart their stock portfolio's descriptive statistics and performance over time in your UI. We drew multiple screens to show how different interactions will change the user interface such as clicking on the links on the webpage. Graph named “Paper Prototype” can be found in the path.
•	UX principles


(5 points) UI/UX Design Focus - Prototyping II: Balsamiq wireframe
•	We created wireframes for the prototype in Balsamiq. Graph named “Wireframes” can be found in the path.
•	Additional UX principles


(10 points) UI/UX Design Focus - Implementation: Updated website user controls
•	We rewrote the charting UIs according to the wireframes we have.
•	Four UX principles.


(5 points) Project videos
•	We made three five-minute videos as required.
•	Each team member spoke in at least two of the videos.


(10 points*2) As we go through the rest of the semester, we will provide a 5-point assignment for five of the topics we cover. You can choose any two of these assignments to earn 10 points and complete your work on the project. Examples:
•	Implement CI/CD pipeline
•	Perform a security analysis of the codebase and website
•	Document your product architecture
•	Implement logging and monitoring
•	Explore new ideas in user interface design


Our choices are “Document your product architecture” and “Explore new ideas in user interface design”.
For the product architecture, a graph named “Structure” can be found in the path.
For new ideas in interface design, we put videos in our login page and designed a cover for our website.
